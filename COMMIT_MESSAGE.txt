feat: implement comprehensive user management and RBAC system

Add complete user authentication, authorization, and management system
with role-based access control, multi-factor authentication, session
management, and comprehensive audit logging.

Backend Changes:
----------------

Security & Authentication:
- Implement dual JWT token system (access + refresh tokens)
- Add JwtTokenProvider with enhanced token generation and validation
- Create JwtAuthenticationFilter with integrated audit logging
- Remove duplicate JwtRequestFilter (consolidated functionality)
- Add JwtAuthenticationEntryPoint for unauthorized access handling
- Implement SecurityAuditService for comprehensive security event tracking

User Management:
- Extend User entity with security fields (MFA, verification, locking)
- Add validation annotations (@NotBlank, @Email, @Size)
- Create strategic database indexes for performance
- Implement UserRole system with global and project-specific roles
- Add UserRoleEntity for role assignments
- Create UserSecurity entity for security-related data
- Add UserSession entity for session management
- Implement UserStatus enum for account states

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
- Define Role entity with RoleScope (GLOBAL, PROJECT)
- Implement hierarchical role system:
  * Global roles: ADMIN, PROJECT_MANAGER, DEVELOPER, VIEWER
  * Project roles: PROJECT_ADMIN, PROJECT_EDITOR, PROJECT_VIEWER
- Add role-based endpoint protection in SecurityConfig
- Configure method-level security with @EnableMethodSecurity

Services & Controllers:
- Enhance AuthService with registration, verification, password reset
- Add UserService for user profile management
- Implement MfaService for two-factor authentication setup/validation
- Create EmailService interface with EmailServiceImpl
- Add SecurityController for security-related endpoints
- Extend AuthController with enhanced authentication flows

DTOs:
- Add request DTOs: RegisterUserRequest, VerifyEmailRequest,
  ResendVerificationRequest, ForgotPasswordRequest, ResetPasswordRequest,
  ChangePasswordRequest, RefreshTokenRequest, SetupMfaRequest,
  ValidateMfaRequest, UpdateUserRequest, CreateInvitationRequest
- Add response DTOs: AuthResponse (enhanced), UserProfileResponse,
  MfaSetupResponse, AuditLogResponse, InvitationResponse
- Include comprehensive validation annotations

Database:
- Add V11 migration: Create user management tables (users, roles,
  user_roles, user_security, user_sessions, audit_logs, invitations)
- Add V12 migration: Insert default roles
- Include proper indexing strategy for performance
- Use JSONB for flexible metadata storage
- Add audit log schema with severity levels

Repositories:
- Extend UserRepository with custom query methods
- Add AuditLogRepository for security event access
- Create UserSecurityRepository for security data
- Add UserSessionRepository for session management
- Implement UserInvitationRepository for invitation system

Exception Handling:
- Add GlobalExceptionHandler for consistent error responses
- Create auth-specific exceptions package
- Structured error responses with codes and timestamps

Frontend Changes:
-----------------

Components:
- Create profile management components:
  * ProfileCard: Display user information
  * ProfileForm: Edit profile details
  * AvatarUpload: Handle avatar images
- Add security components:
  * MfaSetup: Two-factor authentication configuration
- Implement admin components:
  * UserManagementView: Admin user management interface

Services:
- Add profileService: User profile operations
- Create securityService: Security settings (MFA, password, sessions)
- Implement adminService: Admin user management functions
- Update authService with enhanced authentication interfaces

Stores:
- Add profile store: User profile state management
- Create security store: Security settings state
- Implement admin store: Admin functionality state
- Update auth store: Enhanced user model with globalRole

Routing & Layouts:
- Add AdminLayout: Layout for admin pages
- Create admin routes with role-based guards
- Add profile and security routes
- Update Projects view with new role checks
- Implement route guards for authorization

Configuration & Build:
----------------------
- Update build.gradle dependencies
- Update gradle wrapper properties
- Update package.json and package-lock.json
- Enhance SecurityConfig with:
  * CSRF protection (selective for JWT endpoints)
  * Enhanced security headers (HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
  * Comprehensive CORS configuration
  * Session management policies
  * Role-based authorization rules

Documentation:
--------------
- Add ACCOUNT_MANAGEMENT_ARCHITECTURE.md
- Create GIT_AUDIT_REPORT.md with security analysis
- Update roadmap.md with completed features

Repository Cleanup:
-------------------
- Update .gitignore to exclude:
  * System-specific files (gradle.properties)
  * Development scripts (*.sh)
  * Test/debug files (*_response.json)
  * Coverage reports (/frontend/coverage/)
- Remove empty/corrupted directories
- Remove duplicate JWT filter implementation
- Clean up incomplete files

Security Features:
------------------
✅ JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
✅ Password hashing with BCrypt
✅ Role-based access control (RBAC)
✅ Multi-factor authentication (MFA) support
✅ Email verification workflow
✅ Password reset functionality
✅ Account locking mechanism
✅ Failed login attempt tracking
✅ Comprehensive audit logging
✅ Session management with device tracking
✅ Security headers (HSTS, CSP-compatible)
✅ CSRF protection for stateful operations
✅ User invitation system
✅ IP address and user agent tracking

Breaking Changes:
-----------------
- User entity schema extended (requires database migration)
- Authentication flow enhanced (may require client updates)
- New authorization model (role-based access)

Migration Notes:
----------------
- Run database migrations V11 and V12
- Configure JWT secrets via environment variables
- Update allowed CORS origins for production
- Review and configure security headers
- Set up email service configuration
